## 1. Waveforms

## 2. Test Case Strategy
Our 4-bit adder can only represent numbers of just that: 4 bits. We chose our test cases to show, most importantly, that our adder can add, without failure, the numbers that it can and should be able to handle (unsigned 4-bit integers whose sum is also a 4-bit integer). However, we also wanted to show that our adder can gracefully handle

## 3. Test Case Failures
Originally, our board could not handle overflow. In many instances (INSERT EXAMPLES HERE) two positive numbers would sum to a negative number and two negative numbers would yield a positive number. As a result, we realized that we had to do handle overflows differently. XOR
