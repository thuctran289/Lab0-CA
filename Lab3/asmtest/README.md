# Lab3 Test Program: Multiplication

This program multiplies two integers (by default 2 and 3), stores the result to memory and compares the result to expected value.

##Expected Result

The output of the program is a XOR zero flag that checks if the result of multiplication matches the expected result. When the result is correct, the output of the program is going to be “0”.

##Memory Requirements  

```
.data
	one: .word 1
	opA: .word 3
	opB: .word 2
	negtwelve: .word -12
	twelve: .word 12
	ten: .word 10
  ```
