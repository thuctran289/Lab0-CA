## Workplan Reflection:

We managed to follow the guidelines that we made for our work plan relatively well, up until the control part of the lab. Hence, we were relatively on track for finishing with a comfortable lead time up until Tuesday/Wednesday. Unfortunately, we had still underestimated the amount of time necessary for completing the controls. Furthermore, we had also had issues with finding an appropriate time for meetings, which had us sacrificing a day on our schedule. As a result, we had encountered more of a time crunch on Wednesday and Friday than what we had initially desired.
