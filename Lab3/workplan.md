## Work Plan

###Determine phases of each instruction and structure of each phase
Done by Thursday night (2 hours)

### Assembly Test Program
Code by Friday (2 hours)
README by Saturday (1 hour)


### Implement each module in Verilog
Done by Saturday night (work individually on these parts)
modules (30 /min - 1 hr on average per module)
test benches (30 min on average per test bench)

### Connect modules
Done by Sunday night (2 hours)

### Midpoint Checkin with NINJAs
Sunday night - is everything working okay?
Do our plans make sense?
Can we pull off this?
